# Graph sizes (and other info) for the DIMACS 9 and DIMACS 10 graphs we used.
#
# For the experiments we only used the FLA, LKS, E, W, belgium, 
# netherlands and germany graphs. We have included the NY and luxembourg 
# graphs because, due to their size, they are suitable for quick tests.
#
# We refer to the graphs using their map-name abbreviations.
#
#
#
# 1) Graph sizes and map names.
#
# Each line contains information for one graph (map). 
# Lines are of the following form:
# map-name number-of-nodes number-of-edges "full-name"

#
# 3) More graphs.
#
# You can also use other DIMACS 9 or DIMACS 10 graphs. To do so, just 
# download the relevant files, put them in this folder and use their 
# unique identifiers as a map-name. For example, for the Asia DIMACS 10 
# graph (with files asia.osm.graph and asia.osm.xyz) you should use "asia"
# as the map-name. As another example, for the Colorado DIMACS 9 graph 
# (with files USA-road-d.COL.gr, USA-road-d-COL.co and USA-road-t-COL.gr) 
# you should use "COL" as the map-name.
