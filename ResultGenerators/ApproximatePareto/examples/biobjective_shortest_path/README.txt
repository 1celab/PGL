Problem description
---------------------------------
A Bi-Objective Shortest Path (BOSP) example.

Find a shortest s-t path on a random boost graph with two sets of 
weights/costs (called black and red) for the edges. Weights will be 
drawn from a uniform distribution on [1, 100].


How can I compile the example?
---------------------------------
A makefile has been provided. Just run
> make
to make the executable or
> make clean
to delete object files and executables (= everything but the code).
