This folder contains the graphs we used for the experiments.

The graphs are all large scale road maps from the USA and European road 
network. The USA graphs were taken from the 9th DIMACS Implementation 
Challenge (http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml) and the
European graphs from the 10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge 
(http://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/archive/streets.shtml).

Please read file GRAPH-INFO.txt for more info on the graphs.

The graphs won't be included in the git commit, they must be downloaded 
separately.
